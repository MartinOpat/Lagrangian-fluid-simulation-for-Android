# Building using emscripten for WebAssembly

## Introduction

This page describes how to build and install VTK using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org) on any platform.
These steps can be followed inside a docker container that comes with preinstalled `emsdk` such as
[dockcross/web-wasm](https://hub.docker.com/r/dockcross/web-wasm). In fact, the VTK CI stage `webassembly-build`
uses that container to configure and build VTK wasm.

```

## Prerequisites

For this guide, you will need the following:

1. **CMake**: [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) version 3.12 or higher and a
  working compiler. CMake is a tool that makes cross-platform building simple.
  On several systems it will probably be already installed. If it is not,
  please use the following instructions to install it.  There are several
  precompiled binaries available at the [CMake download page](https://cmake.org/download/).
  Add CMake to your PATH environment variable if you downloaded an archive and not an installer.

2. **Emscripten SDK**: [emsdk](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk) and
   any dependencies needed by emsdk.  Emscripten is a complete compiler toolchain
   to WebAssembly, using LLVM, with a special focus on speed, size, and the Web
   platform.  Please download the SDK from
   [github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk). Then,

   - Install latest toolchain with `./emsdk install latest`
   - Activate the toolchain `./emsdk activate latest`
   - Run `emsdk_env.bat` or `emsdk_env.ps1` (Windows) or `source ./emsdk_env.sh` (Linux and OS X) to set up the environment for the calling terminal.

   For more detailed instructions see  [emsdk/README.md](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk#readme).

3. **VTK source-code**: If you have these then you can skip the rest of this section and proceed to [Build project](#build-project).
   Download VTK source for the version you want from
   [https://vtk.org/download/](https://vtk.org/download/)  (zip or tar.gz (Do
   NOT download the exe - this is not the VTK library.) ) You will probably
   want the latest one (highest version number) unless you have a specific
   reason to use an older one.

   Alternatively the source-code can be obtained from the repository as well.
   This is recommended only if you intent to make changes and contribute to
   VTK. Please refer to [git/develop.md](../developers_guide/git/develop.md) for help with `git`.

## Build project

These instructions use a specific convention for the source, build and install directories that is appropriate when building VTK for wasm inside
a docker container. Please replace these _root-directory_ paths if VTK is being built outside a docker container.

1. Configure the project with CMake. `emcmake` tells CMake to use the `emscripten` toolchain for cross compilation.

```bash
$ emcmake cmake \
-S /work/src \
-B /work/build-vtk-wasm \
-GNinja \
-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
-DVTK_ENABLE_LOGGING:BOOL=OFF \
-DVTK_ENABLE_WRAPPING:BOOL=OFF \
-DVTK_MODULE_ENABLE_VTK_hdf5:STRING=NO \
-DVTK_MODULE_ENABLE_VTK_RenderingContextOpenGL2:STRING=DONT_WANT \
-DVTK_MODULE_ENABLE_VTK_RenderingLICOpenGL2:STRING=DONT_WANT \
-DVTK_MODULE_ENABLE_VTK_RenderingCellGrid:STRING=NO \
-DVTK_MODULE_ENABLE_VTK_sqlite:STRING=NO \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install
```

2. Compile.

```
$ cd /work/build-vtk-wasm
$ ninja
```

3. Install the project.

```
$ cd /work/build-vtk-wasm
$ ninja install
```

The binaries are now installed and you may use `-DVTK_DIR=/work/install/lib/cmake/vtk-9.2` to configure VTK wasm applications with CMake.

## Verify installation

If everything went well then it should now be possible to compile and run the one of the C++ examples.
Head over to [Examples/Emscripten/Cxx/Cone/README.md](https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/blob/master/Examples/Emscripten/Cxx/Cone/README.md)
and test the simple Cone example.

## To discuss in thesis
- Check that the uses of "was done" and "will be done" is consistent and makes sense
- Make sure that it is properly distinguished between the time step of switching files (a day), and a simulation time step (dt)
- Make sure that it is clear that fluid simulation and particle simulation is the same thing as we are simulating the fluid as particles (probs. in the intro)
- Update research question


## Android side
- Delete unused project files / folders
- Properly handle the screen layout (see boxVisualization branch)

## Native side
- Delete unused functions
- Take out functions from native-lib into a class called application and make the native-lib only be responsible for JNI communication

## Stuff to research
- Try cuberiles after all
- Direct volume rendering / volume ray casting
- The outline box approach

## General project
- Make sure to use same case (e.g. camelCase)
- Try better rendering methods when exatra time, e.g. thesis draft is being review ->volume rendering / volume ray casting, find new ones
- Mention the different (attempted) different ways of rendering stuff - so far: LIC

## Next meeting points
- Make repo public?
- When all is done, get that best thesis price (pwease) - ask Kehl for recommendation / nomination (https://khmw.nl/khmw-jong-talent-prijzen-khmw-young-talent-awards/)

0 -> wall clock time, no cache clean -> continuous 0, 1
1 -> wall clock time, cache clean -> continuous 2
2 -> CPU / GPU time, cache clean -> continuous 3
0 (5^x) -> CPU / GPU time, cache, clean, small numbers -> continuous 4
3 -> CPU / GPU time, cache clean, parallel crash fix, loader timer wait => wall clock time inaccurate -> continuous 5
